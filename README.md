# North Park SS Announcements Website

As part of the Computer Science 11 (**ICS 3UR**) course, we were told to make a working app for an announcement system that could be used in school.

### What can this website do?

It allows for users to create announcements that are viewable by other users. There is a announcement filtering system for those who need certain announcements over others.
